## Introduction  

My understanding of his assignment is that it will evaluate how well a binary classification model predicts penguin sex using predicted probabilities. I will analyze how changing the probability threshold affects confusion matrices and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Planned Approach  

### 1) Explore the data  

First, I will load `penguin_predictions.csv` into R and inspect the structure of the data. I will:  
- count how many observations are male vs female
- create a bar plot of the actual class (`sex`) to visualize class balance.  

This will help me understand whether the dataset is balanced or not.

### 2) Calculate the null error rate  

I will identify the majority class so the most common sex in the dataset and calculate the null error rate, which is the error rate if we always predicted that class.  

I will explain why this baseline is important.

### 3) Recompute predicted classes at different thresholds  

Instead of relying on `.pred_class`, I will create new predicted labels using:  

```r
ifelse(.pred_female > threshold, 1, 0)
